Overview:
In this assignment, you will create a Java program to calculate and display the average grades of students in a class. You will use classes, loops, and functions to accomplish this task. You can use the homework you have done previously. 

Instructions:
Create a Java program with the following specifications:

Define a class named Student with the following attributes:

name (String): The name of the student.
grades (array of integers): An array to store the student's grades for different subjects. You can assume a fixed number of subjects (e.g., 5).
Implement the following methods within the Student class:

getAverageGrade(): A function that calculates and returns the average grade of the student.
In the main method of your program, create an array of Student objects to represent a class of students. You can decide the number of students in the class (e.g., 5).

Use a loop to input the following information for each student:

Student's name.
Student's grades for each subject.
Display the following information for each student:

Student's name.
Student's average grade.
After processing all students, calculate and display the class's average grade.

Output could look like below and could be a toString function in your class. 




Create a JUnit Test Script: StudentTest.java

This JUnit test script contains test cases to validate the functionality of the Student class's methods. 
In addation the script will contains several test cases that evaluate the getAverageGrade method under different scenarios, including cases with valid and empty grades arrays.

Submit:
You will be submitting the following :

Main Java Program: StudentGradesCalculator.java and StudentTest.java with screen shots of the tests being run. 

This is the main Java program that implements the Student class, processes student data, calculates average grades, and displays the results.
Grading
Your work will be graded based upon the criteria of the rubric.

Feedback
Your instructors will provide feedback for all graded work one week after the due date. Feedback may come in many forms, including scoring the rubric, text in the comment box,  a video in the comment box, and in-text suggestions using the Canvas grading tools. 

Further Clarification
If you need further clarification on any quiz, discussion board, or assignment, please contact your instructors using the Canvas Inbox email tool. Your instructors will get back with you in 24-hours M-F.
